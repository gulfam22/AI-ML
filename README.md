# 💡 AI/ML Internship Tasks – Gulfam

This repository contains 4 AI/ML tasks completed during my internship, including data analysis, model training, and evaluation. Each task focuses on solving a real-world problem using machine learning techniques.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

| Task No | Task Name                            | Description |
|--------|--------------------------------------|-------------|
| 1      | Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset | Performed data inspection and visualizations (scatter plots, histograms, correlation) to understand the distribution and relationships between features in a simple dataset (e.g., Iris). |
| 2      | Predict Future Stock Prices (Short-Term)   | Used time series data and regression (like Linear Regression or LSTM) to forecast short-term stock prices. |
| 3      | Heart Disease Prediction              | Built a classification model using health data (e.g., chest pain, cholesterol, age) to predict the risk of heart disease. |
| 4      | House Price Prediction                | Trained a regression model to predict house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. |
